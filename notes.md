# The Wild Embrace - Project Requirements

- "The Wild Embrace" is a small boutique hotel with 8 luxurious wooden cabins.
- They need a custom-built application to manage everything about the hotel: bookings, cabins and guests.
- This is the internal application used inside the hotel to check in guests as they arrive.
- They have nothing right now, so then also need the API.
- Later they will probably want a customer-facing website as well, where customers will be able to book stays, using the same API.
